      <h1>Simon H. | Kailua, HI</h1>
       <p>I've tried numerous cleaning services before I was lucky enough to link up with Lana! The ultimate professional, reliable, thorough, honest, and kind! I recommend her professional cleaning service to everyone I know.</p>
    </div>
       
    <div class="review">
      <h1>Ned T. | Kaneohe, HI</h1>
       <p>We have enjoyed having Lana clean our home every two weeks for the past two and a half years. She does great work, is very thorough and reliable and is always on time. I love the aromatherapy/essential oils she uses in her non-toxic cleaners. The house smells incredible after shes been here. She is also a real animal lover and is very friendly with our dogs, who love to see her every time she visits. I work from home and so I am usually around when Lana is here, but shes been here alone on many occasions and I trust her completely. If you are looking for someone you can trust who will make your home look and smell spectacular, you will be in good hands with Lana.</p>
    </div>
       
    <div class="review">
      <h1>Gail W. | Kaneohe, HI</h1>
       <p>I have hired cleaning people for over 30 years, both in apartments and in my home. I would rate Lana in the top 3% because of her attention to detail, reliability, and timeliness. When she says she will be here, she is, and always on time. The very first time she came, she asked for a ladder so she could clean our ceiling fan. Really? No cleaning person had ever touched said fan. I knew then that she would be a person who would care for my belongings as much as I would. As time has passed, she has lived up to my expectations, and more!</p>
    </div>
       
    <div class="review">
      <h1>Kuulei L P. | Kailua, HI</h1>
       <p>Lanas attention to detail is fabulous! She is delightful to have in our home and does an amazing job cleaning and problem solving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <h1>Ellen D. | Kaneohe, HI</h1>
       <p>We have had Lana clean our home since she first came to Hawaii some years ago. Lana is not only a true professional but she is also a wonderful person. She is trustworthy, dependable, takes pride in her work, and loves our dogs (the feeling is mutual).</p>
    </div>

       
    <div class="review">
       <h1>Heather M. | Kailua, HI</h1>
       <p>She is the best!! Just wish she wasnt so busy now after we moved, and took a break for a few months. You know she is good when she is so booked up! Our loss.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="review">
      <h1>Paul N. | Kailua, HI</h1>
       <p>Lana is not anything, if not 100% reliable and a complete professional!</p>

       <p>I was in a bind to get my home cleaned prior to putting it on the market the next day, and even though I called her at the last minute in a panic, she quickly responded and swiftly, efficiently, and thoroughly cleaned my home in a few short hours, bringing me great peace of mind.
      </p>
       <p>I will easily recommend Lana to anyone who has a cleaning need in the future, knowing that they are in caring and competent hands.</p>
    </div>

       
    <div class="review">
      <h1>Gwen G. | Monroe, CT</h1>
       <p>My name is Gwen Gangi, I live in Monroe, CT, and I have had Lana Fidelis as a cleaning woman for the past 10 years. ( I cant believe it is that long!)</p>
       <p>I would highly recommend Lana for a number of reasons. She is thorough, efficient and very organized in the manner in which she cleans. She asks you what it is you need from her, and then she organizes herself so she can accomplish her tasks in the most efficient manner. She also has always been very accommodating when asked to do more than the usual routine. I have often asked her to do a deep clean, or a task that only needs to be done periodically. Of course I always pay additional wage for more than the usual routine, but she has never not done what Ive asked, and has often rearranged her schedule to accommodate being at my house for a longer period of time.</p>
       <p>I also trust Lana completely, and that has helped a great deal over the years. She has a key and comes and goes as she needs to and I dont worry at all about leaving my house to her care. She has a great relationship with all my animals, and I have many, and makes sure everyone is where they should be when she leaves.</p>
       <p>I will be very sorry to see her move, we have become friends over the years. She has seen my household and life change, and seen my kids grow. Although she has a replacement who I am sure will be just as good, and who I will also trust. I will miss her and our Monday morning conversations!! My loss will be someone elses gain however, and I couldnt make a higher recommendation, knowing you will be very satisfied with her.</p>
    </div>

        
    <div class="review"><h1>Stephanie L.</h1>
       <p>Lana Fidelis has cleaned our house ever since we moved in six years ago. She does an amazing job and takes such good care of our things, just like it was her own home. She is always on time, organized, competent and reliable. We have found confidence in her honesty and dependability. It is so nice coming home, knowing how clean and fresh smelling it will be because Lana has been there. Because of her care and her friendly, hardworking nature, Lana has become part of our extended family. We would highly recommend her.</p>

    <div class="review"><h1>Janice A.</h1>
       <p>I am pleased to recommend the professional cleaning services provided by Lana Fidelis, owner and operator of her business in Connecticut since 1999.</p>
       <p>We Learned of Lana by way of a referral and have utilized her services since early 2003. Lana has consistently provided us with top-notch services. She is reliable, trustworth, and takes great care to do the job well. Lana places a high value on satisfied clients. She cares for your home and your belongings as if they were her own. To complete the picture, she also provides her clients with realistic and affordable rates.</p>

    <div class="review">
      <h1>Neha O.</h1>
       <p>My name is Neha Ostrosky. I have known Lana for 7 & 1/2 years. She started cleaning our house when I had my first child and it was going to be a temporary thing until things settled down. It only took one time of her at our home to realize that this was no longer to be temporary. My home has never looked or smelled so good. I always thought I was a pretty decent cleaner but now have realized that in no way could I compare to Lana. The sheets on the bed are always cleaned, the bathrooms are spotless, and the kitchen is immaculate, among other things. The whole home looks and smells amazing when she is done. I only wish I could keep her forever. It upsets me to see her leave but I know that she loves the warm weather and needs to be in a warmer climate.</p>

    <div class="review">
      <h1>Jill V.</h1>
       <p>I am very happy to write this letter of recommendation for Lana Fidelis. Lana has been employed as my cleaning lady for the past 14 years. During this time she has never been late or missed a day of work. She is extremely professional, hardworking, dedicated and trustworthy. Lana has also cared for my pets when I am out of town and she is very caring and responsible. I highly recommend her. Any family or business would be extremely fortunate to have her services.</p>

      <h1>Jan S.</h1>
       <p>I am writing in support of my cleaning woman, Lana Fidelis. Lana has cleaned our home for over ten years. She is a lovely person. Lana is dependable and extremely trustworthy. She is a hard worker and has taken wonderful care of my house for these many years. I will miss her terribly when she moves – but some lucky person will get to meet her and hire her when she gets to Hawaii! Thank you</p>
